# STM32 ThreadX_Os

# Overview
This project implements a real-time speed sensor and CAN communication system on a STM32 B-U585I-IOT02A microcontroller using the ThreadX RTOS. The firmware reads pulses from a wheel speed sensor, calculates the wheel’s RPM, and transmits this data over the CAN bus. Debug messages are available via UART.

# Features

 - ThreadX RTOS: Manages concurrent threads for sensor reading and CAN transmission.

 - Wheel Speed Measurement: Uses a timer to count pulses from a speed sensor and calculates RPM.

 - CAN Bus Communication: Sends speed and other messages using STM32 FDCAN peripheral.

 - UART Debug Output: Prints debug and status messages for development and troubleshooting.

# Directory Structure

### Core.
 - Main application source files
### Core/SRC.
 - Source files under ThreadX(threads, CAN, sensor logic, main.c, etc.)
### Core/INC.
 - Header files for application and hardware abstraction.
### Drivers.
 - STM32 HAL and CMSIS drivers.

# How It Works

### 1. Initialization:
 - ThreadX kernel and threads are initialized.
 - CAN queue is created for inter-thread communication.

### 2. Speed Measurement:
 - The sensor thread reads the timer counter, calculates RPM, and enqueues a CAN message.

### 3. CAN Transmission:
 - The CAN_TX thread dequeues messages and sends them over the CAN bus.

### 4. Debugging:
 - UART output provides real-time feedback for development and troubleshooting.

# STM32 Pins Usage
 - FDCAN1_RX -> PB_8 (CAN_RX)
 - FDCAN1_TX -> PB_9 (CAN_TX)
 - TIM1_CH1  -> PA_8 (Sensor speed)

# How to Extend The Project
 - Add new CAN message types by extending the t_can_msg struct and switch-case in the CAN_TX thread.
 - Integrate additional sensors or actuators by creating new threads.
 - Implement a CAN_RX thread to receive, decode, and process incoming CAN frames.
 - Integrate new thread to communicate via I2C to motors/servo.

# Instructions to Build and Flash to STM32 Microcontroller

## Prerequisites
- ARM GCC toolchain (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`)
- CMake
- ST-Link tools (`stlink-tools`)

## Build Process

### 1. Create Build Directory
```shell
mkdir -p build
cd build
```

### 2. Configure CMake with ARM GCC Toolchain
```shell 
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/gcc-arm-none-eabi.cmake ..
```

### 3. Compile the Project
```shell
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Flashing to STM32

### 4. Convert ELF to Binary Format
```shell
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary ThreadX_Os.elf ThreadX_Os.bin
```

### 5. Verify ST-Link Connection
```shell
st-info --probe
```

Expected output should show your STM32 device information.

### 6. Erase Flash (Optional but Recommended)
```shell
st-flash erase
```

### 7. Write Binary to Flash Memory
```shell
st-flash --reset write ThreadX_Os.bin 0x08000000
```

**Parameters:**
- `0x08000000` - Flash memory start address for STM32
- `--reset` - Automatically reset the microcontroller after flashing

---

## Quick Rebuild and Flash
After initial setup, you only need:
```shell
cd build
make -j$(nproc)
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary ThreadX_Os.elf ThreadX_Os.bin
st-flash erase
st-flash --reset write ThreadX_Os.bin 0x08000000
```

# UART Debug Messages

 - Debug messages are sent via USART1 at 115200 baud, 8N1.
 - Use a serial terminal (minicom, screen, etc.) to view output.

## 1. Connect the Board
- Use a USB cable if your board has a Virtual COM Port (e.g., ST-Link VCP)
- Or use a USB-to-Serial adapter connected to the board's UART TX/RX pins

## 2. Find the Serial Port
On Linux, run:
```sh
sudo dmesg | grep tty
```
Look for `/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`, or similar.

## 3. Open a Serial Terminal
You can use `minicom` or `screen`.

**minicom example:**
```sh
minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0
```

**screen example:**
```sh
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

## 4. UART Settings
- Baud rate: 115200
- Data bits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

## 5. View Output
You should now see the debug messages printed by your firmware.

## 6. Kill UART Window
 - Press Ctrl+A then release both and press K
 - When prompted, press y to confirm exit.
